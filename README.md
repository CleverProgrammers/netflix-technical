<br>

## Hero.js

👉🏽 Fix the styling of the `Hero` component. (Title, CTA Buttons, and Hero Image)
<br>
👉🏽 Replace the Lorem Ipsums with the data from the API. (Title and Description/Overview)

<br>

## Row.js

👉🏽 Create Static data for the `Row` component and save to the 'movies' state.
<br>
👉🏽 Get the static data to render onto the screen using the 'movies' state.
<br>
👉🏽 Once you have the static data rendering, replace the static data with the data from the API.
<br>
:warning: **Note:** Notice the `fetchUrl` prop that is being passed into the `Row` component. This is the API endpoint that you will need to use to get the data for each `Row` component. You will need to fetch the data from the API and save it to the `movies` state.
